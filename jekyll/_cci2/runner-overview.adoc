== Introduction

CircleCI self-hosted runner enables you to use your own infrastructure for running jobs. This means you will be able to build and test on a wider variety of architectures, as well as have additional control over the environment. The diagram below illustrates how CircleCI self-hosted runner extends our existing systems.

== CircleCI runner use cases

There are two key use cases CircleCI aims to meet with the self-hosted runner:

* Privileged access & controls - CircleCI understands that some customers require running jobs on on-premises or limited-access infrastructure due to stricter isolation requirements. Some things the self-hosted runner enables are:
** IP restrictions - Runners can have static IP addresses that you can control
** Identity Access Management (IAM) permissions - If you set up runners in AWS, they can be assigned IAM permissions
** Monitor the operating system
** Connect to private networks

* Unique compute requirements - Customers who need to run jobs on an environment or architecture that CircleCI does not offer as a resource class can use the runner to fill that need.

== Getting Started

To get started with CircleCI self-hosted runners:

* Provide your own platform to deploy your CircleCI self-hosted runners (see the <<runner-supported-platforms#,Available CircleCI self-hosted runner platforms>> page for supported platforms)
* xref:runner-installation.adoc[Install] CircleCI self-hosted runners!

== CircleCI self-hosted runner operation

Once a CircleCI self-hosted runner is installed, the self-hosted runner polls `circleci.com` for work, runs jobs, and returns status, logs, and artifacts to CircleCI. When the self-hosted runner is not running a job, it will auto-update itself when a new version is released.

== Limitations

Almost all standard CircleCI features are available for use with self-hosted runner jobs, however, a few features are not yet supported. If these features are important for you to make use of self-hosted runner jobs, please let us know via the relevant canny page.

- The following built in environment variables are not populated within runner executors:
-- CIRCLE_PREVIOUS_BUILD_NUM
-- All deprecated cloud environment variables
